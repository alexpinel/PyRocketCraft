# Imitate the MPCPolicy controller with a neural network
#
# This controller is very simple: load the trained network
# data (generated by expert_train.py) and just run
# inference on the input to the step() function, i.e.
# based on the supplied state, calculate a control input (u)
# vector / action vector.
